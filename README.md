VOOM!
=====

> Then the Voom...
> It went VOOM!
> And, oh boy!  What a VOOM!

> Now, don't ask me what Voom is.
> I never shall know
> Buy, boy! Let me tell you
> It does clean up snow!

- _The Cat in the Hat Comes Back_, by Dr. Seuss

VOOM is some VMWare / vCenter lab management software I wrote to
help me keep track of legitimate uses of a shared, communal lab
environment (focused heavily on BOSH), and mete out swift VM
termination to rogue machines as discovered.
